Leetcode 23 Merge k Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:
          Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
          Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
          Explanation: The linked-lists are:
          [
            1->4->5,
            1->3->4,
            2->6
          ]
          merging them into one sorted list:
          1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:        
        Input: lists = []
        Output: []

Example 3:        
        Input: lists = [[]]
        Output: []
 

Constraints:        
        k == lists.length
        0 <= k <= 104
        0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
        -104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
        lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
        The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.
